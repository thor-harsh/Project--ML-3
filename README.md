**In this project we make build the Polynomial Regression Model to predict the Salary based on Level feature in Position_Salaries dataset**.<br></br>

Polynomial regression is one of the machine learning algorithms used for making predictions of continuous values.<br>
Polynomial regression is a form of Linear regression where only due to the Non-linear relationship between dependent and independent variables, we add some polynomial terms to linear regression to convert it into Polynomial regression.

Explore the dataset before jumping to the code.

**So what are you waiting for...? Jump to the code to get started. As usual for any doubt or query see you inside pull request section 😁😂. Thanks!**
